> **Teorema**: Sia n un numero naturale, n >= 2. Allora n Ã¨ primo se non ammette alcun divisiore primo p con p^2 <= n.

> **Theorem**: Given n, natural number >= 2. n is a prime number if it has no prime divisor with p^2 <= n.

> Example: <br>
n = 151. We want to find out if it is a prime number. <br>
2 -> 2^2 <= 151 (true) but 2 doesn't divide <br>
3 -> 3^2 <= 151 (true) but 3 doesn't divide 151 <br>
5 -> 5^2 <= 151 (true) but 5 doesn't divide 151 <br>
... <br>
13 -> 13^2 <= 151 (FALSE)... STOP <br>
151 is a prime number because every prime, with square <=151, doesn't divide 151. <br>
